# reworld - New game engine experiment.

I really enjoy making game engines, and after creating [Physics](https://github.com/1whatleytay/Physics) I wanted to reuse the code for something new.
Reworld was my attempt at that, it was somewhere in between a game engine and a game at this point.
I got kinda bored when I realized the code was very similar to my previous game engines, so I dropped it.
I archived it here because I think it could be useful to any future game engines I might make.
